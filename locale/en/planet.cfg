[space-location-description]
#star
sol=The sun is the main source of all light and heat in the solar system, with most objects being visible only due to the light from the sun being bounced back towards us.\nWithout the sun providing heat, water would never have formed in the solar system - it would just have stayed as cold ice.

#planet
mercury=Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, with extreme temperature variations.
venus=Venus is the second planet in the solar system, known for its high temperatures and dense carbon dioxide atmosphere.
earth=Earth is the home of humanity and the only known planet to host life.
mars=Mars, known as the Red Planet, is covered in iron oxide and hosts the tallest mountains and largest canyons outside Earth.

jupiter=Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, featuring massive storms and 79 known moons.
saturn=Saturn is famous for its iconic rings made of ice and rock particles.
uranus=Uranus is a gas giant known for its blue-green appearance and tilted rotational axis.
neptune=Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, known for its powerful storms and deep blue color.

#moon
luna=Luna is Earth's only natural satellite, its surface covered with craters and vast basalt plains. It is the starting point of human space exploration.

phobos=The first moon of mars, Phobos is asteroid-like. Unlike earth's moon, phobos travels across the martian sky backwards due to the speed of the orbit along which phobos travels around mars.
deimos=The second moon of mars, Deimos is asteroid-like.

charon=Charon

#asteroid
asteroid-belt-inner=The inner asteroid belt is the only thing seperating Mars and Jupiter. It contains somewhere between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids, by recent estimates.
ceres=Ceres
vesta=Vesta
pallas=Pallas
hygiea=Hygiea

asteroid-belt-outer=Also known as the Kuiper Belt, the outer asteroid belt contains a vast number of mostly ice and carbon-based asteroids, as well as many dwarf planets such as pluto and one of it's moons, charon.
makemake=Makemake
haumea=Haumea
eris=Eris
gonggong=Gonggong
pluto=Although Pluto is no longer classified as a formal planet, its discovery marked the beginning of deep exploration of the outer solar system. Its icy terrain and orbital characteristics continue to captivate scientists.

# Fallback technology description. Used when there isn't a specific technology name available for a planet.
planet-discovery-fallback=This technology currently has no description. It simply unlocks the ability to travel to __1__, which is a star, planet, moon or other location in space.

planet-discovery-sol=The sun was one of 3 objects first discovered by humanity, the others being the earth - where humanity began, and luna - the moon.
planet-discovery-mercury=By observing the motion of stars and carefully probing the planets, scientists successfully discovered Mercury. This planet is the closest to the Sun in the solar system and has extreme temperature variations.
planet-discovery-venus=The discovery of Venus marked a further breakthrough in human exploration of planets. It is Earth's "sister planet," but its thick atmosphere and high temperatures make its surface conditions extremely harsh.
planet-discovery-earth=Earth, as the home of humanity, has been thoroughly explored and studied, and we have finally established its position and unique status in the solar system.
planet-discovery-mars=Mars, the "Red Planet," has become one of the most promising planets for human exploration of the solar system through telescope observation and landing probes.
planet-discovery-phobos=Phobos
planet-discovery-deimos=Deimos
planet-discovery-asteroid-belt-inner=The Main Asteroid Belt
planet-discovery-jupiter=Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, has revealed its complex atmospheric system and rich moon system through the study of its powerful gravity and meteorological phenomena.
planet-discovery-saturn=Saturn is famous for its magnificent rings. The discovery of Saturn gave scientists a deeper understanding of gas giants, especially the mechanisms of its rings and gravitational forces.
planet-discovery-uranus=Uranus is the first planet discovered by telescope. Its extreme axial tilt and blue-green appearance make it a unique presence in the solar system.
planet-discovery-neptune=Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun. Through astronomical observations and theoretical deductions, scientists confirmed its existence and revealed its extreme climate and deep blue atmosphere.
planet-discovery-pluto=Although Pluto is no longer classified as a formal planet, its discovery marked the beginning of deep exploration of the outer solar system. Its icy terrain and orbital characteristics continue to captivate scientists.
planet-discovery-asteroid-belt-outer=The Kuiper Belt
planet-discovery-luna=Through careful observation of celestial bodies near Earth, scientists first recorded and explored Luna. This natural satellite of Earth became humanity's first target for extraterrestrial exploration.
planet-discovery-enceladus=Through the observation of Saturn's satellite system and careful detection of Enceladus, scientists successfully discovered Enceladus. This moon is known for its ice volcanoes and potential subsurface ocean, making it a promising target in the search for extraterrestrial life.
planet-discovery-europa=Through the observation of Jupiter's satellite system and careful detection of Europa, scientists successfully discovered Europa. This moon is covered with a thick layer of ice, beneath which may lie a vast subsurface ocean, providing a suitable environment for extraterrestrial life.
planet-discovery-titan=Through the observation of Saturn's satellite system and careful detection of Titan, scientists successfully discovered Titan. This moon is the only one in the solar system with an atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen with traces of methane and other hydrocarbons.
planet-discovery-ganymede=Through the observation of Jupiter's satellite system and careful detection of Ganymede, scientists successfully discovered Ganymede. This moon is the largest in the solar system, possessing its own magnetic field and potentially harboring a subsurface ocean.
planet-discovery-triton=Through the observation of Neptune's satellite system and careful detection of Triton, scientists successfully discovered Triton. This moon is unique in the solar system as it orbits in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation, and its surface features extensive ice layers and geysers.
planet-discovery-charon=Through the observation of Pluto's satellite system and careful detection of Charon, scientists successfully discovered Charon. This moon forms a binary planet system with Pluto, featuring extensive ice layers and mountain ranges on its surface.
