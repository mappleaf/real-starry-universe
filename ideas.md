| Sol | Space Platform Temperature Management | Space platforms travelling close to the sun must manage their temperature carefully. | This mechanic means that if you bring a space platform too close to the sun, it gets hotter and hotter which decreases the efficency of certain machines and recipes. But if you move a space platform further away from the hot sun, the efficency of making sol-specific science packs goes down. As well as using passive cooling methods such as moving away from the sun and letting the heat dissipate into space, you can also use active cooling methods which use materials such as ice and fluoroketone, as well as likely a few others of the mod's own invention. | The space connection between Sol and Mercury. |
| Sol | Magnetic Field Varience | Certain recipes are more or less efficent depending on the current state of the sun's magnetic field. | This mechanic means that certain recipes can be exceedingly inefficent if the current state of the sun's magnetic field is in the wrong state. This introduces more challenge in when to send a space platform to the sun and back. | The space connection between Sol and Mercury. |
| Sol | Solar Plasma Collection | The collection of solar plasma requires extreme magnetic fields, but the extreme energy contained in plasma is worth it. | This mechanic allows you to generate extreme magnetic fields to extract, process and analyse solar plasma. This is costly as the distances required to extract solar plasma and the inherent temperature of plasma itself are dangerous to all but late game space platforms. |
